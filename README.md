I made Part 1 using Bootstrap. It took me no time and I excitedly jumped into Part 2. Making a carousel from scratch is completey new to me and I like to see good examples of something before I dive right in.

I watched a few YouTube videos and none of them had exactly what I was looking for, so I parsed what I needed from several and was able to make the responsive background, links to navigate between the two pages, auto-play, and working next and previous buttons.

I started with linking the pages. Then I worked in feature sections starting with getting all five images to display in HTML, adding the CSS, and then the JavaScript for that particular part. Then I did this with the buttons.

After getting the slides to aut-play, I worked on the responsivenes.

I saved the nav-buttons at the bottom for last, because I inititally thought it would be an easy addition. After I added them in the html I realized the HTML and JS code I'd already written wouldn't work with the way I was planning to write the JS for the dots.
